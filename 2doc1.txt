Change title and description in home.tsx.
delete welcome folder
to clear errors that occur after that(error occurs because welcome folder previously consisted of the import statement): Hence change:

import type {Route} from "./+types/home";

- and the app still needs the logo that was used back in the welcome page.
- So once we delete it, we might need to reload our application by re-running
    npm run dev.

In the app, create a new Directory - components

create Navbar.tsx
=> rafce
home.tsx
In main function: 
<Navbar />

In the app, create a new directory - constants
under which you need to create a index.ts file

export const resumes: Resume[] = [] // here the Resume is not identified, you need to create a type for it.
Cerate a folder within the root of the application folder
